# Multi-repo Changes Checklist (For Frontend)

- [ ] `POST /gitpoaps` (creating GitPOAPs): Previously, the route accepted a field `githubRepoId`, this has been updated to accept a new field, `"project"`. This field can come in one of two forms, both of which should be sent as a `JSON.stringify`'d string:
  1. In the case that the project should be created with the request, it should be sent:
     ```json
     {
       "githubRepoIds": [3, 4, 5, 9]
     }
     ```
     where the `"githubRepoIds"` are the IDs that GitHub has assigned the repos.
  2. In the case that an existing project should be used, it should be sent the ID of the project within GitPOAP:
     ```json
     { "projectId": 2334 }
     ```
- [ ] The query structure (and return structure) of the GQL `userPOAPs` query has changed from:
  ```graphql
  {
    userPOAPs(address: "burz.eth") {
      gitPOAPs {
        claim {
          gitPOAP {
            repo {
              name
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  to:
  ```graphql
  {
    userPOAPs(address: "burz.eth") {
      gitPOAPs {
        claim {
          gitPOAP {
            project {
              repos {
                name
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  **Note** That this change will need to also happen anywhere else that the FE uses the autogenerated relation queries
- [ ] The GQL `recentlyAddedProjects` query is renamed to `recentlyAddedRepos`
